# Questions about vintage of BEC

The AR2022 version of PSPL is Version 8.  

This version of PSPL incorporates BEC 11 mapping.  

This compares to BEC 12 that is available for general use.  

## Crosswalks

PSPL has been crosswalked to allow the joining of SIBEC data. These crosswalks are based on what isavailable at the time.

When PSPL is joined with vri features, there may be features that do not have a PSPL site index.  The question assisses as to what BEC could or should be used to assign site index.

Using a newer version of BEC than what was used in  the PSPL my introduced the requirement for new crosswalk tables to be derived.
