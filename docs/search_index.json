The processing of PSPL has changed for 2023. The revised process reflects how an input to Batch TIPSY would handle site index conversion to provide site index for species that are missing a site index. Note that the PSPL data was prepared by Jeff Kruys (under contract). Version 8, released oct 2021 1.1 Site Productivity (SP) Points A set of points are generated that cover the province in a regular grid a grid point is only generated where the point covers a forested area a site index is assigned to this point in a hierarchical manner PEM/TEM + SIBEC PEM/TEM map the spatial site series SIBEC provides the site index look up tables for the site series SIBEC currently does not cover all site series found in PEM/TEM PEM/TEM does not cover the entire province only the approved PEM/TEM are used for TSR BIOPHYSICAL Model where SIBEC is not complete or a PEM/TEM is not available, a biophysical model is used to generate site index the biophysical model is expanded by +/-5% beyond the range of the climate association to encompass more than the original range. beyond this, NULL site index values are generated, leading to some SP points appearing in the data with NULL values based on climate BC data 2002 1.2 Features missing PSPL points The species that are assigned a site index are those for which there is an ecological site association for those species. This can sometimes differ from species that are actually planted on the site. This can lead to gaps. These missing site index values can cause an ERROR and termination of Batch TIPSY during processing. In these cases, alternative methods of supplying a site index are used preemptively to prevent processing errors. Section - 2 PSPL Process Overview The following figure represents the process used to mill in missig site index values for the AR2022 processing. Section - 3 Create feature_id means Import all PSPL points from GDB into PostgreSQL Import the veg_comp_lyr_r1_poly geometry and feature_id into PostgreSQL Intersect all PSPL points with the veg comp feature_id Derive Mean values for each feature_id Example feature_id at_si ba_si  sw_si sx_si yc_si 1810686 18.2 15.0 2001498 19.3 There are 22 site index by species column in the PSPL data. Section - 4 Create BEC zone/subzone means Group Data from the feature values into BEC zone/subzone Derive group mean Section - 5 Missing Site Index Values Fill in missing values associated with the species list for each feature 5.1 Species required for each feature_id The MSYT process generates a species list for each feature_id that includes both the current and future assignment of species composition. For the 2 features listed above the species that require site index are: feature_id species 1810686 {At,Fdi,Lw,Pl,Py,Sw} 2001498 {At,Cwi,Fdi,Hwi,Pl,Pw,Sw} And the PSPL mean data has the following site index values. feature_id at_si cw_si fd_si hw_si lw_si pl_si pw_si py_si sw_si sx_si 1810686 18.2 17.2 * 17.1 15.0 * 15.0 2001498 * 18.7 17.1 15.0 17.1 * * 19.3 Feature 1810686, has site index values are missing for Lw and Sw. Feature 2001498, has site index values are missing for At, Pw and Sw. It is important to note that while Sw site index is missing for both features, a site index is supplied for Sx. This will be used as one of the first site index substitutions as Sx is commonly used in the PSPL as opposed to the more specific Sw, Se or Ss. Since there are only site index equations for Se, Sw and Ss these will be substituted base on BEC. 5.2 Find where species is missing a site index Join the species list to the feature site index data. Find where a species is missing a site index and tag them. At this point, this table summarizes how many features have complete site index for species: src n pct PSPL 1039574 18 Total 5526737 Table 1. Base PSPL Missing Site Index values Initially, the raw PSPL has site index values for all required species for 18%. Section - 6 Run the Spruce Substitution Substitute Sx site index under the following conditions Se = Sx where BEC = ESSF Sw = Sx where BEC != ESSF and BEC is not coastal Ss = Sx where BEC is coastal (CDF, CWH, MH) Update the tags for missing where the Spruce Substitution has filled the site index. src n pct PSPL 1039574 18 Spruce Conversion 667801 12 Total 5526737 Table 2. After SX substitutions After substituting for Sx, the valid site index percentage has increased to 30%. Section - 7 Use SIndex site conversions Site tools SIndex provides a standard set of coefficients for site index conversions. These are provided in the appendix. The next step is to apply the site index conversions only for those species that have a missing site index. This procedure is used so that chaining of the site index conversions are minimized. Again, update the tags for missing where the Spruce Substitution has filled the site index. Section - 8 Additional Site Index conversions The use of the standard SIndex conversion coefficients has shown that there are some species conversions that are missing. The following substitutions are being used to address this. 8.1 Interior Western Cedar (Cw) If there is no site index provided for Cw and the BEC zone is NOT in CWH, CDF, or MH, then it is assigned using the White Spruce site index: cw_si = sw_si 8.2 Sitka Spruce The standard PSPL process runs a set of site index conversion equations only once. That is, the use of a converted site index is avoided if possible. Under certain conditions, this may leave site index values missing. In the case of Sitka Spruce (Ss), the conversion equation for Western Hemlock(Hw) is used a second time to fill in gaps: ss_si = -4.943820220 + 1.248439450 * hw_si 8.3 White Pine Similar to Sitka Spruce, White Pine can end up with missing site index values. In this case, two equations were required to fill in missing site index values, one for the coast and one for the interior: pw_si = ss_si (coastal) pw_si = fd_si (interior) 8.4 Yellow Pine Also similar to Sitka Spruce, Yellow Pine can end up with missing site index values. In this case, Douglas Fir site index is used: py_si = fd_si 8.5 Alder The first discussions around missing site index values for Alder (Dr) suggested a direct site index substitution using Douglas Fir. An examination of these site indices lead to a discussion that possibly the values were too high. Limited data from RPB (George Harper) suggested the following: Coast dry: bec_zone in (CWH,CDF,MH) and bec_subzone in (ds,db,xm) dr_si = fd_si * 0.55 Coast Wet: bec_zone in (CWH,CDF,MH) dr_si = fd_si * 0.73 8.6 Shore Pine There are occurrences of low density Shore Pine (Pl in coastal BEC). These are being treated as Non Commercial or are being removed it they are the last species in the list. Examples: CWH wh, Pl with planted density = 20 removed from planted species list BEC zone CDF, CWH or MH, if natural species 5 is Pl, replace with Ncc Ncc is not counted in the reported merchantable volume, but occupies space in terms of overall site occupancy. 8.7 After SIndex and augmented conversions src n pct PSPL 1039574 18 Spruce Conversion 667801 12 SIndex Conversion(1) 3249093 58 Total 5526737 Table 3. After SIndex conversions where a species is mising a site index. The valid site index percentage has increased to 88%. Section - 9 Use BEC zonal means At this point, we are still missing site index for approx 10% of the features. The PSPL zonal BEC means will be used to substitute where missing, but they need to be processed further before use. The Spruce Substitution is run first, followed by the SIndex conversions. In this case, a species missing approach is not used and the SIndex conversions are run in a brute force manner. The updated BEC means are then used to substitute where a species is missing a site index in the feature based data. Again, update the tags for missing. At this point, there should be no missing site index values. src n pct PSPL 1039574 18.8 Spruce Conversion 667801 12.1 SIndex Conversion(1) 3249093 58.8 BEC Conversion 570269 10.3 Total 5526737 100 Table 4. After BEC substitutions. Section - 10 BEC Substitutions At this point, there may still be missing values in the features. To overcome this, the recommendations from Regional Ecologist were used to build an acceptable BEC substitution (crosswalk) table.
